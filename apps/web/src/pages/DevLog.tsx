          <p>
            Problem Statement 01 asked for a data intelligence platform — something that could find and structure information the
            internet already has, instead of making someone dig for it by hand. We started by looking at who does that digging
            today: event teams hunting sponsors and judges, job seekers checking listings one tab at a time, sales teams rebuilding
            lead lists that are already stale by the time they’re shared. Different people, same broken workflow. The harder
            question was trust — an AI that guesses at a company’s email isn’t useful, it’s just confidently wrong. So before
            writing a line of the pipeline, we set one rule: nothing ships unless we can point to the exact page it came from.
            Everything after this commit was in service of that rule.

              We rebuilt the core pipeline more times than we'd like to admit — searches that returned nothing, extractions that
              missed everything but one sponsor, a rate limit that took down an entire job. Every failure taught us something the
              last version didn't know. What's live now finds over a hundred real, sourced results in about a minute, with every
              field traced back to where it came from — no guesses, nothing we can't point to.
